# The Organization of the Website

Eaglesmith, Justus, Tim Johnson, and Robert W. Walker.  2025.  *The performance of widely used language models tasked with identifying the distribution responsible for generating simulated data.*

The directory `Final-Prompt-Results` contains [all the results](https://github.com/robertwwalker/LLM_Distributions/tree/main/Final-Prompt-Results).  They are organized hierarchically by model [0409-turbo, 0806, and 0613] and then by distribution.

- The [0409-turbo page](./Final-Prompt-Results/0409-turbo/Complete.Analysis-0409.html)
- The [0806 page](./Final-Prompt-Results/0806/Complete.Analysis-0806.html)
- The [0613 page](./Final-Prompt-Results/0613/Complete.Analysis.html)

[A sample prompt](./Final-Prompt-Results/Prompt-1.html)

In each subdirectory, there are: 

- a series of .qmd files containing Combiner.  These combine the input and output files [in jsonl format] with the original .RData files.
- a series of .RData files with `Full` that represent the combined input, output and RData files.
- a series of .RData files with an R random generation function that store the original calls and data.
- a .R file containining Combiner that binds the rows of the Full data files.
- Two sets of .jsonl files: output contains the OpenAI responses and -Call-Revised.jsonl contains the batch files sent to OpenAI.
