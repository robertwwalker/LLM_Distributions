NB: The following is an after the fact summary.  I have not compiled the document as the bottleneck was always the interaction with OpenAI.  This merely summarizes the file order and invocations to repeat the experiment.

# Generate the Data for Open AI

```{r}
library(quarto)
quarto_render("General-Batch-Beta-Final.qmd")
```

# Merge the Open AI Results

```{r}
quarto_render("Beta-Combined12.qmd")
quarto_render("Beta-Combined22.qmd")
quarto_render("Beta-Combined32.qmd")
quarto_render("Beta-Combined42.qmd")
quarto_render("Beta-Combined52.qmd")
```

# Bind the Full.Beta files together

```{r}
source("Final-File-Combiner.R")
```
