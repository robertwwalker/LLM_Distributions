NB: The following is an after the fact summary.  I have not compiled the document as the bottleneck was always the interaction with OpenAI.  This merely summarizes the file order and invocations to repeat the experiment.

# Generate the Data for Open AI

```{r}
library(quarto)
quarto_render("General-Batch-Lognormal-Final.qmd")
```

# Merge the Open AI Results

```{r}
quarto_render("LogNormal-Combiner01.qmd")
quarto_render("LogNormal-Combiner05.qmd")
quarto_render("LogNormal-Combiner51.qmd")
quarto_render("LogNormal-Combiner55.qmd")
```

# Bind the Full Lognormal files together

```{r}
source("FInal-File-Combiner.R")
```
