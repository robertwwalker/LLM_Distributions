<p>Below, I am going to provide you a stem-and-leaf-plot of a variable and the summary statistics for that variable. I would like you to tell me which distribution you think generated the data.<br/><br/><br/>  The decimal point is 1 digit(s) to the left of the |<br/><br/>  0 | 392<br/>  2 | 0473<br/>  4 | 3<br/>  6 | 5<br/>  8 | 4<br/><br/><br/>Here are the summary statistics: Min. = 0.03441; 1st Qu. = 0.141; Median = 0.2508; Mean = 0.3191; 3rd Qu. = 0.4031; Max. = 0.8438 <br/>The data type is: not discrete.<br/><br/>Please use the above information to predict which distribution generated the data. Please do not provide an explanation in your response. Please only state the name of the distribution in one word. Do not include the word &#039;distribution&#039; following the name of the predicted distribution. Indeed, please read your response after writing it and ensure that you only provide the name of the distribution in your response.</p>
